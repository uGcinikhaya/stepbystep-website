    <p class="lead">
      My name is Gcinikhaya Mthethwa, i've had quite a bumpy and very eventful journey. In my high schooling career i wasn't really sure of what i wanted to become professionally, so that indirectly lead to me being a very underwhelming performer, when it came to academics. Graduated from High School with a Diploma National Senior certificate, which limited what i would be able to choose from once applying for different career paths. I then tried my hand in many things such as, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering which even then i was not passionate about, so my performance was never what i could regard as my best. The Year 2016 a shift occured in my life that required me to stop thinking i have time to fool around and be a kid. the following year in 2017 my mother passed away and that left me in a very stressful state, and to make it out it needed me to grow up and be a man, even though i had just turned 20. I got a job and fortunately got a learnership to become a Clinical Pathology Medical Technician, the duration began in January 2020 and i passed my board exam in November 2021.

      It is the year 2023 now and i seek to do something more with my life, i want to become a Data Analyst(Scientist), i've learnt a bit of Python, Java, HTML and CSS. I now seek to focus solely on Python and SQL in order to dedicate myself to this new commitment i have made. I am 26 years old and Bootcamps seem to be my only way to learn these languages and better prepare myself for the next phase of my life.

      What Is Data Science? And Why Did I Choose This Path?
    </h2>
    <p class="lead">While the terms may be used interchangeably, data analytics is a subset of data science. Data science is an umbrella term for all aspects of data processing—from the collection to modeling to insights. On the other hand, data analytics is mainly concerned with statistics, mathematics, and statistical analysis. It focuses on only data analysis, while data science is related to the bigger picture around organizational data.In most workplaces, data scientists and data analysts work together towards common business goals. A data analyst may spend more time on routine analysis, providing regular reports. A data scientist may design the way data is stored, manipulated, and analyzed. Simply put, a data analyst makes sense out of existing data, whereas a data scientist creates new methods and tools to process data for use by analysts.

      <b>What is the difference between data science and business analytics?</b>
      While there is an overlap between data science and business analytics, the key difference is the use of technology in each field. Data scientists work more closely with data technology than business analysts.Business analysts bridge the gap between business and IT. They define business cases, collect information from stakeholders, or validate solutions. Data scientists, on the other hand, use technology to work with business data. They may write programs, apply machine learning techniques to create models, and develop new algorithms. Data scientists not only understand the problem but can also build a tool that provides solutions to the problem.It’s not unusual to find business analysts and data scientists working on the same team. Business analysts take the output from data scientists and use it to tell a story that the broader business can understand.
      <b>What is the difference between data science and data engineering?</b>
      Data engineers build and maintain the systems that allow data scientists to access and interpret data. They work more closely with underlying technology than a data scientist. The role generally involves creating data models, building data pipelines, and overseeing extract, transform, load (ETL). Depending on organization setup and size, the data engineer may also manage related infrastructure like big-data storage, streaming, and processing platforms like Amazon S3.Data scientists use the data that data engineers have processed to build and train predictive models. Data scientists may then hand over the results to the analysts for further decision making.
      <b>What is the difference between data science and machine learning?</b>
      learning?Machine learning is the science of training machines to analyze and learn from data the way humans do. It is one of the methods used in data science projects to gain automated insights from data. Machine learning engineers specialize in computing, algorithms, and coding skills specific to machine learning methods. Data scientists might use machine learning methods as a tool or work closely with other machine learning engineers to process data.
      <b>What is the difference between data science and statistics?</b>
      Statistics is a mathematically-based field that seeks to collect and interpret quantitative data. In contrast, data science is a multidisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, and systems to extract knowledge from data in various forms. Data scientists use methods from many disciplines, including statistics. However, the fields differ in their processes and the problems they study.

      Aspirations and what I seek to achieve from this career
    </h3>

      <b>How Health Care Data Analytics is Used by Medical Providers: Examples of Data Analytics in Healthcare?</b>
      The best way to discover how data is used in health care is to take a look at real-life examples of big data analytics in healthcare. Vie Healthcare Consulting tells the story of how data analytics informs preventative care.
      Preventative care is essential for health care systems and patients. It can help prevent future illness and patient readmissions to health systems. It can also promote better patient outcomes and lower health insurance costs. This is especially true of high-risk patients and those with chronic diseases. Cancer screenings, well-child visits and counseling on smoking cessation are all examples of preventative care. By identifying risk factors that could have gone unnoticed, health care analytics can be used to promote better preventative care.
      Lisa Miller, contributor to the Vie Healthcare Consulting blog, gives an example of how health care analytics can promote preventative care through insurance companies.
      Miller explains that in 2017, Blue Cross Blue Shield analyzed several years of pharmacy and insurance data. The data was related to opioid abuse and overdose. Through the analysis, Blue Cross Blue Shield was able to effectively identify almost 750 risk factors that can predict whether or not someone is at risk of abusing opioids.
      “Gathering all of this data was only possible with the help of analytics experts and the right software solutions,” Miller said.


      <b>How Data Analytics in Health Care Improves Patient Care
      </b>
      One of the most amazing things about data analytics in health care is that it enables health systems and clinicians to make better care decisions for patients.
      “In health care, decisions often have life-altering outcomes—both for patients and the population as a whole,” said Catherine Cote in the same Harvard Business School article from above. “The ability to quickly gather and analyze complete, accurate data enables decision makers to make choices regarding treatment or surgery, predict the path of large-scale health events and plan long-term.”
      Data analytics is helpful to health care professionals and organizations. Both health care providers and health systems need health information and data that makes sense. Without accurate data, they can’t make decisions that are in patients’ best interests. Data analytics provides these institutions with the data they need to make decisions that lead to superior patient care. This not only improves patients’ quality of life, but can also extend their life.

      <b>What Is the Future of Data Analytics in Health Care?</b>
      Like data analytics in all sectors, there is a solid future for data analytics in health care. This is particularly true in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.
      Data analytics in health care has grown in importance during the pandemic. Hundreds of thousands of individuals around the world have required health care for treatment of the coronavirus. Health care organizations have utilized data analytics to manage the global health crisis and better treat patients.
      The need for quality healthcare will remain constant. For this reason, data analytics in health care will always be relevant, and jobs in this field will remain in-demand. For example, the Journal of Ahima states that while the demand for jobs in data analysis is high in every industry, the most emerging role is that of health care data analyst.
