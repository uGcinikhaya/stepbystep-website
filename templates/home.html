      My name is Gcinikhaya Mthethwa, i've had quite a bumpy and very eventful journey. In my high schooling career i wasn't really sure of what i wanted to become professionally, so that indirectly lead to me being a very underwhelming performer, when it came to academics. Graduated from High School with a Diploma National Senior certificate, which limited what i would be able to choose from once applying for different career paths. I then tried my hand in many things such as, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering which even then i was not passionate about, so my performance was never what i could regard as my best. The Year 2016 a shift occured in my life that required me to stop thinking i have time to fool around and be a kid. the following year in 2017 my mother passed away and that left me in a very stressful state, and to make it out it needed me to grow up and be a man, even though i had just turned 20. I got a job and fortunately got a learnership to become a Clinical Pathology Medical Technician, the duration began in January 2020 and i passed my board exam in November 2021.

      It is the year 2023 now and i seek to do something more with my life, i want to become a Data Analyst(Scientist), i've learnt a bit of Python, Java, HTML and CSS. I now seek to focus solely on Python and SQL in order to dedicate myself to this new commitment i have made. I am 26 years old and Bootcamps seem to be my only way to learn these languages and better prepare myself for the next phase of my life.

      What Is Data Science? And Why Did I Choose This Path?

    <p class="lead">"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"
